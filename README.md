# PlasmidAI - Biotech CRO Plasmid Design Platform

A beautiful mockup application for a biotech CRO focused on assembly and cloning of plasmids. This prototype demonstrates an AI-powered chat interface for plasmid inventory management and custom design workflows.

## Features

### ðŸ§¬ AI-Powered Plasmid Search
- Natural language queries to search plasmid inventory
- Intelligent matching of gene names and annotations
- Real-time chat interface with typing indicators

### ðŸ”¬ Visual Plasmid Representation
- Interactive circular plasmid maps
- Color-coded feature annotations
- Detailed feature information and positioning

### ðŸ“Š Sequence Alignment
- Visual comparison of multiple plasmids
- Highlighted differences and insertions
- Expandable sequence viewer with position markers

### âš¡ Custom Design Generation
- AI-assisted plasmid modification
- Tag insertion and custom modifications
- Sequence preview with feature highlighting
- Approval workflow for designs

### ðŸ›’ Integrated Ordering System
- Complete checkout flow
- Multiple delivery options (Standard, Expedited, Urgent)
- Format selection (DNA, Glycerol Stock)
- Order confirmation and tracking

## Demo Workflow

The application demonstrates this complete user journey:

1. **User asks**: "Do I have a plasmid that contains the gene MYC?"
2. **AI responds**: Shows 3 matching plasmids with visualizations
3. **User asks**: "What is the difference between them?"
4. **AI shows**: Detailed sequence alignment highlighting differences
5. **User requests**: "Help me make a new variation with a FLAG tag"
6. **AI designs**: Custom plasmid with FLAG tag insertion
7. **User approves**: Design and proceeds to checkout
8. **Order placed**: Complete with confirmation and tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Running the Demo

1. Click the **"Run Demo"** button in the chat interface
2. Watch the automated conversation flow
3. Interact with the visualizations on the right panel
4. Explore the different components:
   - Plasmid circular maps
   - Sequence alignment viewer
   - Custom design interface
   - Checkout system

## Technology Stack

## Customization

### Adding New Plasmids
Edit the `mockPlasmids` array in `src/context/PlasmidContext.js`:

```javascript
{
  id: 4,
  name: "pYOUR-PLASMID",
  description: "Your plasmid description",
  sequence: "ATGC...",
  length: 5000,
  features: [
    { name: "Gene", start: 100, end: 500, type: "gene", color: "#ff6b6b" }
  ],
  tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"],
  company: "Your Company"
}
```

### Modifying the Demo Conversation
Edit the `demoConversation` array in `src/context/PlasmidContext.js` to customize the chat flow.

### Styling Changes
- Colors: Modify the custom colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- Animations: Adjust Framer Motion settings in individual components
- Layout: Update Tailwind classes throughout components
